You are an expert technical editor. Your task is to rewrite the provided PRD draft to fix all the issues listed in the JSON evaluation report.

Instructions:

- Fix ALL issues mentioned in the evaluation report
- Do not add new sections unless fixing an issue requires it
- Do not change content that is not related to an issue
- Maintain the overall structure and flow of the document
- Produce a new, complete, and corrected version of the entire document

For each issue type:

- Fluff/Marketing Language: Replace with direct, factual statements
- Vague Metrics: Add specific numbers, timeframes, and measurement methods
- Quality Theater Metrics: Replace with operational metrics (DAU, error rates, etc.)
- Missing Quantification: Add concrete numbers and sources
- Technical Unrealism: Adjust to realistic percentages and timelines
- Vague Placeholders: Make placeholders specific and actionable
- Missing SKU Differentiation: Add "Target SKU: Core/Premium" labels
- Missing Citations: Add footnotes and sources
- Traceability Issues: Link requirements to problems, metrics to goals

The output should be a complete, improved PRD that addresses all identified issues while maintaining professional quality and readability.
