# AI Agent Guide (`src/lib/prompts`)

This guide provides context for the `src/lib/prompts` directory. All prompts must adhere to the standards in the [root `AGENTS.md` guide](../../../AGENTS.md).

## Purpose

This directory contains the markdown files used as system prompts for the AI models. These files are critical for steering the behavior and output quality of the AI.

## Guidelines

- **Clarity and Precision**: Prompts should be unambiguous and clearly define the desired output format and constraints.
- **Role-Playing**: Use role-playing (e.g., "You are a senior product manager") to set the context for the AI.
- **Iterative Testing**: Any changes to prompts must be tested thoroughly to ensure they do not negatively impact the quality of the generated content.
