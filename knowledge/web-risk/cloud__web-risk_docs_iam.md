# Access control with IAM

Google Cloud offers[Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs), which lets you give granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources.

Web Risk provides access control for Web Risk APIs using [VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs).

To learn how to assign IAM roles to a user or service account, read [Managing policies](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies) in the IAM documentation.

## Permissions and roles

This section summarizes the permissions and roles Web Risk supports.

### API permissions

Web Risk does not require any special permissions to call any APIs. This means you can use service accounts with no IAM roles.

## VPC Service Controls

VPC Service Controls supports Web Risk to provide additional access control for Web Risk APIs. For more information, see[Supported products and limitations > Web Risk](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products#table%5Fwebrisk).
